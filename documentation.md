#Docs

Welcome to the documentation for investa_gator.  The intention of this tool is to automate the analysis and data collection processes related to human trafficking.  Much of the knowledge that went into this tool came out of my time as a researcher fighting slavery.

##Installation

Unfortunately, at present there are quiet a few dependecies to using the tool.

1) A c++ compiler - if you are on ubuntu or mac this is pretty easy to get:

__on__ __ubuntu__:

`sudo apt-get install build-essential`
`sudo apt-get install g++`

__on__ __mac__:

Download and install xcode [instructions here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)

__on__ __windows__:

Unfortunately there is no "standard" way to install a c++ compiler on windows.  There are a number of options.

I recommend install cygwin and making use of there installer to get g++.  But you could also get visual studios and then make use of the c++ compiler that comes with it.
